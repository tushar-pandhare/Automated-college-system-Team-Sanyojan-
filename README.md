## Problem Statement

Colleges often struggle with transparency in administrative processes, student elections, financial tracking, and complaint management. Manual processes lead to delays, lack of accountability, and limited student involvement. An automated, paperless system can improve efficiency, fairness, and accessibility.

## Background

Current college administrative processes lack transparency, efficiency, and accessibility for students and faculty. There is no centralized digital system to manage elections, approvals, complaints, budget tracking, and student-related notifications. This results in delayed processes, lack of accountability, and limited visibility for students and faculty members.

## Proposed Solution

We propose developing a web-based platform that digitizes key administrative functions in a transparent and structured manner. This platform will ensure fair elections, automated approvals, budget accountability, anonymous complaint handling, and make key information accessible to students and faculty. The system will promote transparency, efficiency, and accountability across the college's administrative processes.

## Key Features & Functionalities

### 1. Student Election System
- Online election platform for student councils with detailed candidate profiles.
- Secure voting mechanism with authentication using college email IDs.
- Live result tracking to ensure transparency in election results.

### 2. Automated Health & Leave Notifications
- Automated emails sent to class coordinators when a student is reported sick by the college doctor.
- Automated notifications to parents if a student leaves campus, ensuring safety and tracking.

### 3. Campus Facility Booking System
- Online prior booking system for campus facilities (e.g., tennis courts, auditorium).
- Approval mechanism from relevant authorities.
- Availability status visible to students and faculty.

### 4. Transparent Application & Approval System
- A centralized portal to submit applications for event organization, budget approvals, and sponsorships.
- Applications are visible to all students and faculty for transparency.
- A structured approval workflow where designated authorities review and approve requests.
- Priority-based escalation for unattended applications.
- Real-time tracking of application status for all stakeholders.

### 5. Academic Integrity & Cheating Record System
- Public display of student names, reasons, and proof for cheating incidents during exams.
- Ensures transparency regarding academic integrity violations.

### 6. Anonymous Complaint System
- Allows students to submit complaints anonymously.
- Complaints are visible to all members of the college community.
- Moderation system filters out inappropriate content.
- The identity of anonymous complainants is revealed only if a majority of board members approve.

### 7. Transparent College Budget & Sponsorship Tracking
- Public visibility of all college sponsorships and budgets (including event funds and departmental budgets).
- Proofs of expenses (bills, receipts, images) must be uploaded for verification and transparency.
- Transparent tracking of mess budgets managed by student bodies.

### 8. Restricted Access for College Members Only
- The platform is accessible only through college email IDs, ensuring authenticity and security.

## Expected Impact

- **Transparency:** All administrative processes, applications, budgets, and election results are publicly accessible to students and faculty.
- **Efficiency:** Automation of approvals, notifications, and tracking reduces the need for manual work and enhances workflow efficiency.
- **Accountability:** Budget tracking and complaint handling provide mechanisms to prevent misuse of funds and power.
